# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
[] Create Todo Task with task name , Description & status [] By default status needs to added as not completed for created todo [] There should be two buttons in the name of edit and Delete which used to perform update and delete created todos [] By onclick on status it should show a dropdown for completed and not completed by that we can change the status of todo [] All todos should be displayed in Card [] There should be filter to display status completed, not completed and both statuses The TODO app is created using bootsrap and react where hooks are used buttons are used to edit or delete the tasks

Install via package manager Install Bootstrap’s source Sass and JavaScript files via npm, RubyGems, Composer, or Meteor. Package managed installs don’t include documentation or our full build scripts. You can also use any demo from our Examples repo to quickly jumpstart Bootstrap projects.

npm install bootstrap@5.3.3 Include via CDN When you only need to include Bootstrap’s compiled CSS or JS, you can use jsDelivr. See it in action with our simple quick start, or browse the examples to jumpstart your next project. You can also choose to include Popper and our JS separately.
